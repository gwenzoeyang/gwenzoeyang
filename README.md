Hi there! This is my github portfolio, and it's a work in progress. Feel free to poke around, or take a look at my most recent project, where I leveraged MongoDB, Typescript, and Google Gemini create a course scheduling app that serves my school community!: [SchedulEZ repo](https://github.com/gwenzoeyang/schedulEZ)

Here is the link to the actual deployment!: [SchedulEZ site](https://schedulez.onrender.com/)
